Welcome to my site! 

<h1>Introduction</h1>

Are you looking for a dog to adopt? If so, you probably want to know everything about the pet you choose: it's health condition, character, maybe nutrition issues? There's something for you - TinDog! 

<h2>Description</h2>

TinDog is based on simple idea: you can browse through all dogs in the shelter, check how they look, what are their features and, if one of them would melt your heart, directly e-mail the shelter to get more information and maybe schedule the visit. To not get yourself lost in the variety of loving dogs, you can click on the heart icon and add any pet to your own list - and then browse it again!
