Welcome to my site! 

During last week of Coders Lab Bootcamp we were supposed to creat our own project. I decided to basy my project on simple idea of creating easy for users and administrators page and on my love for pets! 

That's how I created TinDog - app for finding your forever friend in animal shelters.
