Welcome to my site! 

During last week of Coders Lab Bootcamp we were supposed to creat our own project. As I have a lot of love for all pets, but mostly dogs, I decided to create TinDog - app for finding your forever friend in animal shelters. 

Main page let you check dogs that are available for adoption. Each position has a picture of dog and brief information about its features. If you are interested in adopting a dog or have any questions about it, you can send an e-mail to the shelter directly from main page.

If you can't decide which dog to adopt, just click on heart icon and it will move pet to Your List view. Clicking on X icon let you check out another dog.

On Your List you can look through your saved dogs and check all informations again. Again - this view gives you an opportunity to contact shelter.

TinDog also provides an option of adding new dog's profile to the list. Life can be rough and sometimes someone we know can't keep his dog anymore. TinDog helps such people to public informations about dog and is a great way to find a new loving home for pets.

To create TinDog I used ReactJs library, Sass as CSS preprocesor and Firebase as a way to storage my data. Site is fully responsive and mobile friendly.
